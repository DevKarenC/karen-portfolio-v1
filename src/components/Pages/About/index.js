        Hi there! My name is Karen Choi and I'm a former auditor turned software
        engineer. Before attending the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack
        Academy, I spent 8 months self-studying and building various projects
        (thanks to The Odin Project and teachers on YouTube!) everyday after
        work. Now that I am graduated from the immersive software engineering program, I am excited to start working again in the tech
        industry! ðŸ¥³ Feel free to connect with me on{' '}
